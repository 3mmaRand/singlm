# Binomial GLM overview {#bino-glm-overview-5}

When a response variable can take only one of two values such as 0 and 1, dead and alive, no and yes or failure and success it follows a binomial distribution and can be modelled with a binomial GLM.  A binomial GLM is also known as logistic regression. 
Although the observations themselves can have only one of two values, the scale of the response is a probability representing the probability of 1, alive, yes or success. The link function used in a binomial GLM is the "logit" function also known as "log-odds". This means the model estimates are also log-odds. This can make it tricky to interpret the estimates but two things can help us. First, the principle about the sign of $\beta_{1}$ still applies: positive $\beta_{1}$ indicates an increase in the response with an increase in $X1$ and negative $\beta_{1}$ indicates a decrease in the response with an increase in $X1$. Second, we can use the `predict()` function to get values on the scale of the response, a probability, rather than the log-odds


When you have a single explanatory variable, that model is:

\begin{equation}
ln\left(\frac{E(y_{i})}{1-E(y_{i})}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1_{i}
(\#eq:glmbino)
\end{equation}

This means that the model estimates are odds logged to the base $e$ and and the inverse function, `exp()` must be applied to them to interpret as odds. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{E(y_{i})}{1-E(y_{i})}=exp(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1_{i})
(\#eq:glmbino2)
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
\frac{E(y_{i})}{1-E(y_{i})}=exp(\beta_{0}) \times exp(\beta_{1})^{X1_{i}}
(\#eq:glmbino3)
\end{equation}

This looks complicated. Using the predict function because important in reporting the results.

Just like Poisson GLM with a single explanatory variable, there are two parameters in this model, $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{0}$ and their meaning is similar. Let us assume our response is failure or success. Then $\beta_{0}$ is the log odds of success when the explanatory variable is 0 and $\beta_{0}$ is the change in the log odds of success for each unit change in the explanatory.

<!-- of the expected $y$ when $x$ is zero - the intercept. The log of $\beta_{1}$ is not the amount you *add* to $y$ for each unit change in $x$ but the amount by which multiply. This means the model is a curve. If $\beta_{1}$ is positive, $exp(\beta_{1})$ is greater than one and $y$ increases as $x$ increases; If $\beta_{1}$ is negative, $exp(\beta_{1})$ is less than one and $y$ decreases as $x$ increases. See Figure \@ref(fig:glm-bino-poss) for an illustration of the curve for positive and negative $\beta_{1}$. -->


What exactly are odds? An odds is the probability of one outcome divided by the probability of not that outcome. For example, for a fair coin where heads and tails are equally likely, the odds of a head in a coin toss is 1 because:

$\frac{P(H)}{P( not\:head)} = \frac{0.5}{ 1- 0.5} = 1$

If you had an unfair coin where the probability of a head was $\frac{3}{4}$ then the odds of a head are:

$\frac{P(H)}{P( not\:head)} = \frac{0.75}{ 1- 0.75} = 3$

A head is three times as likely as a tail. If instead probability of a head was $\frac{1}{4}$ then the odds of a head are:

$\frac{P(H)}{P( not\:head)} = \frac{0.25}{ 1- 0.25} = 0.33333$

A head is a third as likely as a tail.

The estimated model parameters, $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ must be exponentiated to be interpreted on the scale of the response. When $x=0$ we predict the number of $y$ to be $exp(\beta_{0})$. For each unit of $x$, the number of y changes by a factor of $exp(\beta_{1})$




For the binomial families the response can be specified in one of three ways:

As a factor: ‘success’ is interpreted as the factor not having the first level (and hence usually of having the second level).

As a numerical vector with values between 0 and 1, interpreted as the proportion of successful cases (with the total number of cases given by the weights).

As a two-column integer matrix: the first column gives the number of successes and the second the number of failures.
